# Toy Store Simulator

## About

A python application simulating a toy store/ factory logictics using a factory method. A centralized controller controls the the `order`, `inventory` and `factory` objects to correctly distribute the different orders to different factories. The orders are then either fulfilled or rejected based on specifications (View the UML [here](./UML.pdf)!).

## Project Status

This project is still in the works. I plan to add a frontend and a database and turn it into a full stack app to deploy.
